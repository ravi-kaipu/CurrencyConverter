# CurrencyConverter

>CurrencyConverter is a script that indicates the conversion rates of different currencies in a popup message. <br />
>This is primarly developed to check the conversion rates from SEK to INR.<br />

Hope we can use this script for other currency conversions as well by changing from_currency, to_currency and url params in conversion_details.json file.
